    What is the difference between border-boxand content-boxbox-sizing in CSS? Which is the default?


        Border-box and Content-box are the two different values of box-sizing.
        Content-box is the default value of box-sizing.  
        
        1. Content-box :- 
        
            The dimension of element only includes ‘height’ and ‘width’ and does not include ‘border’ and ‘padding’ given to element, Padding and Border take space outside the element.

        2. Border-box :- 
        
            The dimension of element not only includes ‘height’ and ‘width’ but also include ‘border’ and ‘padding’ given to element.
