    What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.


        1. Inline CSS applies CSS styles directly into the HTML code using the style attribute.

        Advantages :- 

                        Using inline CSS is the ease with which you can style a particular web page component.
                        This ability to change the styling of any specific element.
                        Inline CSS makes testing a style or changing a particular style on a webpage effortless.
                        Iline CSS doesn't require external files or links, this means you can streamline the development process as all the code is within the HTML code.

        Disadvantages :-

                        Inline CSS makes the code as a project gets bigger and bigger.
                        With different styles scattered throughout the HTML, editing the webpage or making global changes becomes more complicated and bug-prone.
                        It also increases repetition when multiple elements in the HTML need the same styling which makes the code large and complex to read, increasing the likelihood of bugs.

        
        2. Internal CSS is a way of applying CSS to a webpage that involves using a style tag in the head section of the HTML file.

        Advantages :- 

                        In internal CSS, the styles are confined to the specific page, which helps avoid conflicts with styles on other pages.
                        Internal CSS provides greater control and customization of the individual pages of a website.
                        Internal CSS can contribute to faster page loading times, as no additional HTTP requests are needed to fetch an external stylesheet.

        Disadvantages :-

                        In internal CSS each HTML file must have a separate style section with the same CSS code when different pages need the same style.
                        his repetition not only increases the overall size of the website but also complicates maintenance since any changes to the styles must be done manually in every file.
                        It leads to inconsistencies and a higher chance of errors, making internal CSS less efficient.
                        Internal CSS is the increased HTML file size which leads to longer load times for users with slower internet connections.

        3. External CSS involves styling in a separate .css file and linking it to an HTML document using the link tag in the head section.
        This way of writing CSS promotes the reusability of styles and better organization across multiple pages.

        Advantages :- 

                        External CSS is reusable, as a single stylesheet can be linked across multiple web pages, significantly reducing repetition and redundancy.
                        It makes development more streamlined and makes things like site-wide updates much more straightforward and efficient.
                        Im user's first visit it uses browser caching to download and store the external stylesheet in the browser cache, which can be used by browser to quickly retrieve the cached CSS file significantly reducing load times.

        Disadvantages :-

                        External CSS relies on additional HTTP requests to load the stylesheet. Each time a web page is accessed, the browser must fetch the external CSS file, which can cause a delay.
                        Sometimes on slower networks or if the server hosting the stylesheet is under heavy load, the webpage may render without styles if the CSS file fails to load due to network issues or server errors.
