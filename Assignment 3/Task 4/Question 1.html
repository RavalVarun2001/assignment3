    Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox?

        CSS Grid Layout is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that allows web developers to create complex and responsive designs with rows and columns.
        It provides precise control over both horizontal and vertical alignment, making it ideal for creating structured layouts.
        We can in us grid in Full-page layout over flexbox because allows control over both rows and columns.
        We can in us grid in Complex overlap designs over flexbox because enables precise placement with grid-template-areas.

        Grid

            It works in two dimensions, meaning it can control both rows and columns simultaneously.
            It is best suited for full-page layouts where you need precise control over both horizontal and vertical placement of elements.
            It provides precise alignment across both rows and columns using properties like align-items, justify-items, and place-items.
            It allows elements to be placed in specific grid cells using grid-column and grid-row, making complex designs easier.
            It is more structured and layout-focused, making it ideal for designing entire sections of a webpage.
            
        Flexbox
        
            It works in one dimension, meaning it controls either a row or a column, but not both at the same time.
            IT is best for arranging items inside a single container, such as navigation bars, cards, or aligning buttons in a row.
            It primarily controls alignment along one axis using justify-content and align-items.
            Its items are arranged in a linear order and cannot be placed in custom positions as easily as Grid.
            It is more flexible and content-driven, making it ideal for small UI components like menus, cards, and form layouts.
