    Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

        Web-Safe Fonts
        
            They are pre-installed on most devices.
            They do not require additional downloads, ensuring fast loading.
            Examples: Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana, Courier New, Georgia, Helvetica.
            
        Custom Web Fonts
        
            They are not pre-installed on devices; they must be loaded from an external source.
            They provide more design flexibility and unique typography.
            Examples: Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Poppins.

        Reasons to use a Web-Safe font over a custom font
        
            They have faster page load speed because Web-safe fonts do not require additional HTTP requests, reducing load time.
            They have better compatibility because They work across all devices and browsers without needing fallbacks.
            They have no External Dependencies but custom fonts require downloading from a CDN or server, which may slow performance.
            They ensure consistent readability without rendering issues.
