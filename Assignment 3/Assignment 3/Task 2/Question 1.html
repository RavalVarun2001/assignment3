    Explain the CSS box model and its components. How does each affect the size of an element?


        The CSS box model is a way to design and lay out web pages using a rectangular box that surrounds each HTML element.
        The box model has four components: content, padding, border, and margin.
        Each component affects the size of an element by adding space around it. 
        
        1. Content :-
        
            The area where text, images, and other media are displayed.
            The size of the content area is controlled by the width and height properties.

        2. Padding :-
        
            The space between the content and the border.
            The size of the padding area is controlled by the padding property
            
        3. Border :-
        
            The frame that surrounds the padding and content.
            The size of the border area is controlled by the border property and related properties.
            
        4. Margin :-
        
            The space between the border and the surrounding elements.
            The size of the margin area is controlled by the margin property.
