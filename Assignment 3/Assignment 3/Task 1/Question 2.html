   Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple styles get resolved?
   
        If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the style declaration of selector with the highest specificity will be applied to that HTML element.
        Specificity is a hierarchy that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element.
        Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an element.
        It determines the property value to apply to the element. 
        The specificity algorithm calculates the weight of a CSS selector to determine which rule from competing CSS declarations gets applied to an element.
        The weight is determined by the number of selectors of each weight category in the selector matching the element or pseudo-element.
        If there are two or more declarations providing different property values for the same element, the declaration value in the style block having the matching selector with the greatest algorithmic weight gets applied.
