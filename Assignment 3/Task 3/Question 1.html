    What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms flex-container and flex-item.

        CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout model that allows efficient arrangement, alignment, and distribution of elements within a container, even when their sizes are dynamic or unknown.
        It is particularly useful for creating responsive web designs, as it enables easy control over element positioning along one dimension (either row or column).
        Flex-Container is the parent element that holds flex items which controls the direction and alignment of child elements.
        Flex-Item is the direct child elements of a flex-container.


        Benifits

            It makes it easier to align elements both horizontally and vertically.
            It handles dynamic resizing of elements without breaking layouts.
            It reduces the need for floats and positioning hacks.
            It supports flexible spacing between elements.
